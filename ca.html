			<p class="fact red">What is Community Acupuncture?</p>
			<p class="p">At The Community Acupuncture Clinic of Eureka, treatments are offered in a community setting. This simply means is that instead of being treated in a room by yourself, which is what you might experience in other acupuncture clinics, there will be up to three other people being treated in the same space. The main room of the clinic is partitioned in a way that allows for privacy while maintaining the awareness that you are healing within a community. There is also a small room available that provides more privacy if you prefer to be treated in a room by yourself. While this arrangement might sound strange at first, many people find that once they get used to it they quite like it. It shouldnâ€™t take long to realize the benefits of community acupuncture, as there are many.</p>

	<p class="fact red">What are the benefits?</p>
	<p class="p p1">The most obvious benefit of community acupuncture is the sliding scale, which makes regular acupuncture treatments more accessible to the people in our community. Importantly, acupuncture works optimally when you get consistent treatments. Depending on your condition, this can mean getting treated up to 2x/week for several weeks. Seeing you regularly lets me get to know you better and allows you to give me feedback, so together we can figure out the channels and points that are most effective for your healing, and the treatments that you enjoy the most.</p>
	<p class="p pm">Another benefit to this structure of acupuncture is that friends can come in together and sit side-by-side while being treated. Or if a family member has never gotten acupuncture before, you can bring them with you. It will probably make them more comfortable to sit beside you for their first treatment.</p>
	<p class="p pl">Some people say a there is a peaceful feeling that's palpable in the room when several people are receiving acupuncture at the same time. As a practitioner I definitely enjoy the feeling of having several people healing together in one room.</p>
